    "The algorithm partitions a circuit in slices, using a graph for each time-step of the circuit, which includes large-weight (infinite) edges for interactions at the given time-step and time-decaying weights (exponential used here) for future interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *partition* here is a list which tells us which partition each qubit is assigned to $[\\phi(q_0), \\phi(q_1),..., \\phi(q_{N_q})]$, which determines the local and non-local interactions. *Valid* partitions are defined as those for which all interactions at the current time-step are local. The final solution we are looking for is a list of valid partitions, one for each time-step of the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts with some heuristic for providing a starting partition for the static interaction graph, which is a graph with all interactions from the circuit summed into edges. It is also possible here to specify an initial partition, such that an external initial partitioning heuristic can be used (use the choose initial kwarg). There is also a kwarg \"remove_singles\" which removes layers which have single qubit gates only. This reduces the depth but makes it harder to extract a circuit afterwards - I choose to keep the single qubit gates in so I can visualise the result afterwards, it does't make a complexity difference because these layers are automatically valid from the previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *main_algorithm* produces the list of graphs and performs the fgp algorithm to produce a list of partitions. It also tracks and returns a *mapping*, which is a one-to-one mapping of circuit qubits to physical qubits. It doesn't affect the teleportation cost, but it is useful for visualising the result."
